# sonarr-darkness
A custom dark theme for ([Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/) [v3](https://forums.sonarr.tv/t/sonarr-v3-alpha/19577)

⚠ WARNING ⚠ I am not a proper CSS developer, and I am sure there are issues with some of the things I have implemented here. I'm simply sharing this because it makes Sonarr dark in a somewhat appealing way, and I figured someone out there may be interested.

## ROADMAP
- add support for color-impaired mode.

## SCREENSHOTS
more to come
